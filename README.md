# 90days Digital-Design 

A 90 day Guide to excel in digital design logics and also Soc designs.

## Welcome to 90-Day Digital Design Journey

This repository is a personal commitment to mastering **Digital Design Logics** and **SoC (System-on-Chip)** design from scratch to an advanced level — over a span of 90 days. I'm not here to just *learn* — I'm here to **design**, **implement**, and **excel**.

---

## Objective

By the end of these 90 days, I aim to:

- Master advanced **Verilog HDL** design principles.
- Understand **synchronous/asynchronous logic**, **FSM design**, **clock domains**, **AXI**, **DMA**, and more.
- Build real-world digital systems using **Vivado**, **FPGA**, and **IP integration**.
- Complete **6 minor** and **3 major projects**.
- Document everything here with full transparency — mistakes, corrections, breakthroughs.

---

## Motivation

Too many people stop at theory. I'm here to **build logic** from the ground up — no copy-paste, no shortcuts. This repo will serve as:

- A learning documentation 
- A digital design diary 
- A knowledge base for anyone walking the same path
